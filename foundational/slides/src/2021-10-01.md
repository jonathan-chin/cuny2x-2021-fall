# Intro: The Course

This series of workshops is designed to give you an introductory look at core web technologies, like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In the process, you will also begin to think and act like a coder.

There are no final projects and no homework assignments. We aim to provide a full, robust learning experience entirely contained within the 3 hours you are here.

---

# Intro: The People

Let's quickly go around the zoom and have everyone say:
1. Your name
2. What you are studying at Medgar
3. A technology (software, app, hardware, etc) that excites you

# Best Coding Practices: Development Environment

Your *development environment* (DE) is basically the set of tools you will use on a coding project. An analogy would be if you were contracted to paint a room: decisions like the brand of paint you use, whether you use a paint roller or a spray gun, etc are up to you. Whatever gets the job done.

Most of the time, you will have full control over your DE. However, in this course, we will all use the same tools to facilitate learning.

---

# Best Coding Practices: Repl.it

Repl.it is a *cloud based* *integrated development environment* (IDE). IDEs are the same as DEs except that they are rolled all into the same application. This means that everything you need to code successful projects for this workshop series is available on Repl.it

Let's get started!

# Repl.it
## Account creation, navigation, familiarity

# Best Coding Practices: Whitespace 1/2

Whitespace is the spaces, tabs, and new lines between text. Most programming languages don't care about how much whitespace you use and using *more whitespace* generally makes your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. This is critical as a newcomer to coding since it will make your experience so much better.

On the next slide, both sets of code are identical in terms of their end result. Can you spot the differences?

---

# Best Coding Practices: Whitespace 2/2
```
for(let x=0;x<10;x++){console.log(x);}
```
is the same as:

```
for(let x = 0;
    x < 10;
	x++){
    console.log(x);
}
```

# Best Coding Practices: Save Often, Test Often!

Coding projects are often long and complicated, with later parts of it dependent on earlier parts of it. Because of this, it is so much easier to find bugs when you **save often** and **test often**! It is not unusual to write 5 lines of code and test it, even if those lines are really small!

Ever wonder why coders have 2+ screens? They usually put their raw code on one screen and the compiled end product on another screen, so they can immediately see how one impacts the other.

# Intro to HTML

---

# Intro to HTML 1/1

The acronym HTML stands for *Hyper Text Markup Language*. It is a standardized, common markup language that powers the web. Every website you visit uses HTML; many apps today also use HTML.

It is a *markup language*, which means that its computing power is very limited / non existent. It cannot complete computational tasks. Instead, it determines *how text and elements are arranged on the page.*

---

# Intro to HTML 2/2

HTML consists of regular text mixed with *tags*. If no tags are present, your computer relies on the default formatting that your browser provides. For example, this is completely valid HTML code:

`hello world`

But to have further control over how it's presented to the user, we need to use *HTML tags*.

---

# Intro to HTML 3/3

The simplest tags are structured in this way:

`<tag_name>text to be applied to</tag_name>`

Here are some examples:

```
<p>If music be the food of love, play on</p>

Shall I compare <strong>thee</strong> to a summer's day?

Look on <em>my</em> works, ye <small>mighty</small>, and <strong><em>despair</em></strong>!
```

---

# Intro to HTML 4/4

Some tags need extra information, called *attributes*. This is their general structure:

`<tag_name attribute_name='attribute_value'>text to be applied to</tag_name>`

The most common way you will be using *attributes* today is when displaying images. Here is how images are created in HTML:

`<img src='url to image' />`

You might notice that there is no *closing tag* for `<img />`; this is true for a small handful of HTML tags.

---

# Intro to HTML 5/5

A comprehensive resource for learning HTML is W3 Schools. This website is also great to refer back to after you have learned HTML but may have forgotten some things. It also is great for several other languages and concepts.

# HTML Workshop

---

# HTML Workshop 1/3

Let's write some HTML code together. Let's build a *one page* website about our hopes and dreams for this workshop series.

---

# HTML Workshop 2/3

Ok! Now that you have a sense of how to write HTML, let's start working more independently. In groups, collaborate on a *single page* website that describes all of your experiences so far since the 1st day of classes. Answer these questions:

1. What did you do?
2. What did you learn?
3. What are you still unclear about?
4. What are you hopeful for about next week?

---

# HTML Workshop 3/3

Use the W3 Schools website as a guide for all the HTML tags you need to use:

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp

Be sure to include:
1. 1 list of things
2. 3 links to other sites
3. 3 images
4. 2 buttons (even if they don't do anything)
5. 1 each of h1, h2, and h3 tags (these are headings)
6. several paragraph tags
7. 1 table of things
